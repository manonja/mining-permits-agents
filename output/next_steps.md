Here are three prioritized, actionable next steps for the mining project:

1.  **Action:** Conduct a detailed review against the **Reviewable Projects Regulation** under the BC Environmental Assessment Act (BCEAA) to definitively determine if the project meets or exceeds a threshold triggering a formal Environmental Assessment. Simultaneously, initiate preliminary contact and pre-engagement discussions with the BC Environmental Assessment Office (EAO).
    *   **Priority:** This is the foundational critical path item. Confirming the regulatory pathway is paramount as it dictates the entire assessment process, study requirements, timelines, and required application types (formal EA vs. potentially solely Mines Act/Water Sustainability Act permitting). Engaging the EAO early ensures alignment with their process expectations from the outset.

2.  **Action:** Undertake thorough research to identify all potentially affected Indigenous Nations based on the precise project location and potential impact areas within the Kootenay region (considering traditional territories, land use, watersheds, etc.). Develop and implement a strategy for early, respectful, and meaningful engagement with the leadership and members of these identified Nations.
    *   **Priority:** Early and ongoing engagement with potentially affected Indigenous Nations is a fundamental requirement under the BCEAA and critical for securing social license and navigating the assessment and permitting processes in BC. Indigenous Nations hold inherent rights and title, and their input, concerns, and Indigenous Knowledge must be understood and incorporated from the earliest stages. Delays in this area can lead to significant project risks and timeline impacts.

3.  **Action:** Initiate targeted environmental baseline data collection programs, prioritizing critical parameters identified in the preliminary assessment. This should immediately focus on collecting multi-season data for water quality (including extensive testing for acid rock drainage/metal leaching potential given the sulfide mineralization, cobalt, nickel, arsenic, etc.), hydrology (surface and groundwater flow regimes), and initial ecological surveys (aquatic and terrestrial habitats, potentially sensitive species). Simultaneously, begin refining the preliminary project description focusing on proposed mining methods, processing, waste rock management, and tailings storage strategies.
    *   **Priority:** Robust baseline data is essential for understanding the existing environment, predicting potential project impacts, informing mitigation measures, and supporting any future EA or permit applications (e.g., Mines Act, Water Sustainability Act). Collecting multi-season data often requires at least one year or more, making it a time-sensitive critical path item. Refining the project description early helps focus baseline studies and identify key environmental risks and design considerations related to waste management from sulfide mineralization.
