**Project Overview**
*   Project Location, Site Description, and Access Routes (including proximity to sensitive areas and existing infrastructure)
*   Proposed Mining Methods (e.g., open pit, underground) and Ore Processing Techniques (including beneficiation, leaching methods, and reagent use specific to cobalt recovery)
*   Key Infrastructure Requirements (e.g., power supply, water pipelines, access roads, processing plant, accommodations, waste rock storage, tailings storage facility)
*   Project Schedule and Phases (e.g., exploration, construction, operations, closure, post-closure monitoring)

**Potential Environmental Effects**
*   Impacts on Water Quality (including potential for elevated concentrations of cobalt, nickel, arsenic, and other associated heavy metals, as well as changes in pH and turbidity from mining and processing activities)
*   Management of Waste Rock and Tailings (including potential for Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) and Metal Leaching (ML) from sulfide-bearing materials often associated with cobalt ores, and planned mitigation measures)
*   Effects on Fish and Wildlife Habitat (including direct disturbance from infrastructure, noise, dust, and potential impacts on aquatic habitats from watercourse crossings or discharge)
*   Environmental Monitoring and Management Plans (including proposed programs for water quality, air quality, noise, vibration, and ecological monitoring, and contingency plans for potential incidents)
