**Project Overview**

*   **Project Location and Access:** Description of the project site within the Kootenay region, including geographical coordinates, proximity to existing communities and infrastructure, and details on current and proposed access routes (e.g., upgrades to existing roads or construction of new access).
*   **Mining Methods and Processing Techniques:** Outline of the proposed mining method (e.g., underground or open pit), ore extraction processes, and the chosen processing techniques specific to magmatic sulfite-associated cobalt mineralization (e.g., crushing, grinding, flotation, potential hydrometallurgical steps like leaching or refining to produce a cobalt concentrate or intermediate product).
*   **Infrastructure Requirements:** Identification of necessary project infrastructure, including the processing plant, waste rock storage facilities, tailings storage facility, access roads, power supply (e.g., connection to grid or on-site generation), water supply and management systems, administrative buildings, maintenance shops, and potentially a camp for workers.
*   **Project Timeline:** High-level schedule indicating key project phases from current exploration/studies through permitting, construction, operational life, and proposed closure activities.

**Potential Environmental Effects**

*   **Water Quality Impacts:** Assessment of potential impacts on surface and groundwater quality, specifically addressing the potential for Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) and Metal Leaching (ML) from sulfide-rich waste rock and tailings. This includes the potential release of cobalt, nickel, copper, iron, and other co-associated heavy metals, as well as potential changes in pH and suspended solids.
*   **Waste Rock and Tailings Management:** Description of the characteristics of waste rock and tailings (particularly their sulfide content and potential for ARD/ML), proposed management strategies including storage facility design, liner systems, water management within storage areas, and potential for long-term stability and encapsulation measures to mitigate environmental risks.
*   **Impacts on Local Fish and Wildlife Habitats:** Evaluation of potential direct and indirect impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including potential habitat alteration or loss from mine footprint, disruption of wildlife movement corridors, effects on riparian areas, and potential impacts on fish health and populations from changes in water quality or flow regimes in nearby water bodies in the Kootenay region.
*   **Plan for Environmental Monitoring:** Outline of the proposed environmental monitoring program covering baseline data collection and ongoing monitoring during construction, operation, and closure phases. This includes monitoring parameters such as water quality (chemical constituents including cobalt and heavy metals, pH, flow), air quality (dust, emissions), noise, soil quality, and the health and presence of key indicator fish and wildlife species.
