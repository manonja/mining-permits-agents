Based on the project scale of 'Small', a formal Environmental Assessment (EA) is not automatically triggered. The likelihood requires a review of the specific activities planned for the Northern cobalt project against the thresholds outlined in the BC Environmental Assessment Act and its associated regulations (like the Reviewable Projects Regulation - RPR).

Key provincial acts and regulations that will almost certainly apply to this cobalt mining project include:
*   BC Environmental Assessment Act
*   BC Mines Act
*   Water Sustainability Act
