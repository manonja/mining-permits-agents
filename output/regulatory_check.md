Based on the project scale being 'Medium', a formal Environmental Assessment is **EA Potentially Required**. Further detailed review against the specific thresholds outlined in the Reviewable Projects Regulation (RPR) under the BC Environmental Assessment Act is necessary to confirm if the project meets or exceeds a trigger for a reviewable project (e.g., specific production capacity, mine type, disturbed area, etc.).

Key provincial acts and regulations that will almost certainly apply to this cobalt mining project in British Columbia include:

1.  **BC Environmental Assessment Act** (and associated regulations like the Reviewable Projects Regulation) - Governs the environmental assessment process for major projects.
2.  **Mines Act** (and associated regulations like the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia) - Regulates the operation, health, safety, and reclamation aspects of mines.
3.  **Water Sustainability Act** - Governs the use and stewardship of water resources, including water rights and wastewater discharge.
