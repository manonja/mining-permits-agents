Welcome! As the Project Intake Specialist, I'm here to help gather the initial details for your cobalt mining project to kick off the environmental assessment process. Please provide the following information:

1.  **What is the proposed name for your project?**
2.  **In which general region of British Columbia (e.g., Skeena, Kootenay, Cariboo, etc.) is the project located?**
3.  **What is the type of cobalt mineralization (e.g., sediment-hosted, magmatic sulfide-associated, hydrothermal vein, etc.)?**
4.  **What is the estimated operational scale of the project (Small, Medium, or Large)?**

Once you provide this information, I will compile it into the initial project profile.
