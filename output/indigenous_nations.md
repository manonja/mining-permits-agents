Based on the provided simplified lookup table and the general project location in the Kootenay region, a placeholder Indigenous Nation name potentially relevant is:

*   Placeholder Nation Gamma

Please be advised that this is a highly simplified and generalized example of a deeply complex and sensitive aspect of the environmental assessment process and Indigenous relations. Identifying and engaging with potentially affected Indigenous Nations requires thorough research, including reviewing detailed maps of traditional territories, consulting provincial databases, and direct communication with Indigenous governments and communities. Numerous Nations often have overlapping traditional territories, and project impacts can extend beyond immediate physical footprints. This placeholder does not reflect the actual diversity or specific territories of Indigenous Nations in the Kootenay region, such as the Ktunaxa Nation, Sinixt Nation, Okanagan Nation Alliance members, and others, who hold inherent rights and title to their lands. Accurate identification and respectful, early engagement are critical foundational steps for any project.
