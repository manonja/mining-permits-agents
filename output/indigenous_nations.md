Based on the general project location in the Skeena region, **placeholder** Indigenous Nations that might potentially be affected include:

*   Skeena Nation
*   Kootenay Nation

**Please note:** This is a highly simplified example for illustrative purposes only. Identifying potentially affected Indigenous Nations is a deeply complex and sensitive aspect of the environmental assessment process. It requires careful, thorough, and respectful engagement based on detailed information, including traditional territories, land use, and interests. A comprehensive identification process involves researching Indigenous governance structures, engaging directly with Nations, and consulting official sources, recognizing that traditional territories often overlap and Nations may have diverse interests in a project area. The actual process is much more nuanced than this placeholder example suggests.
