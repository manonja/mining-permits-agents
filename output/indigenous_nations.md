Based on the simplified lookup table for the 'Skeena' region, potential placeholder Indigenous Nations could include:

*   Skeena
*   Kootenay

Please note: This is a highly simplified example for illustrative purposes only. Identifying potentially affected Indigenous Nations for a real project in British Columbia is a deeply complex and sensitive process. It requires thorough research, often involving geographic data, historical context, traditional use studies, consultation protocols, and direct engagement with various Nations. Multiple Nations' traditional territories may overlap, and precise project boundaries are critical. This simplified exercise does not reflect the rigour, respect, and extensive engagement required in a real-world environmental assessment process to properly identify and engage with all potentially affected Indigenous Nations.
