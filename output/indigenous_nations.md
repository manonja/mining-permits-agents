Based on the general project location in the Kootenay region and utilizing the provided simplified lookup table, a potential placeholder Indigenous Nation name is:

*   Placeholder Nation Gamma

**Disclaimer:** It is critically important to understand that this is a highly simplified placeholder example for illustrative purposes only. Identifying Indigenous Nations whose traditional territories, rights, and interests may be affected by a resource project in British Columbia is a deeply complex, nuanced, and sensitive process. It requires thorough research, detailed mapping (including overlapping territories), careful consideration of historical and contemporary land use, and, most importantly, early, meaningful, and respectful engagement directly with Indigenous Nations themselves. A comprehensive process would involve identifying many more Nations in the Kootenay region, understanding their specific interests related to the project, and initiating engagement based on government policy, legal requirements, and the principles of Reconciliation. This placeholder does *not* reflect the actual list of potentially affected Nations in the Kootenay region, which would be much more extensive and require careful, Nation-specific analysis.
